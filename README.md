### Project Overview: Autonomous Line Follower and Obstacle Avoider with Path Memory

In this project, we design and build an intelligent robotic system capable of navigating from Point A to Point B autonomously, following a predetermined line while avoiding obstacles. Our robot stands out by incorporating a unique feature: it can remember its path, enabling it to retrace its steps back to Point A after reaching Point B. This is achieved through a combination of line-following sensors, obstacle detection mechanisms, and a sophisticated path memory algorithm.

Key highlights of our project include:

- *Line Following*: The robot follows a pre-laid path using sensors that detect the line's color, ensuring precise navigation towards the destination.
- *Obstacle Avoidance*: Equipped with sensors, the robot can identify and navigate around obstacles that obstruct its path.
- *Path Memory and Reversal*: As the robot travels, it records its movements. Upon reaching Point B, marked by a Red Color Box, it switches to recall mode and accurately retraces its path back to Point A, overcoming the challenges of reversing direction and encountering obstacles once more.

This combination of line-following and obstacle avoidance, coupled with an innovative path memory system, makes our robot a versatile solution for automated navigation tasks in dynamic environments.
